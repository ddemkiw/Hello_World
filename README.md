Hello World!
=======================

## Synopsis

This is my first proper commit to Github! 

Hello. World. Indeed. 

My name is Danielle and I'm a Business Analyst turned developer from the Canadian West Coast.

Although I have a corporate background working in Law and the Financial Industry, my most recent post was with a software company in Canada and that's where I fell in love with code and what it can do. 

I am currently living in London and attending Makers Academy where I intend to hone my skills as a computer programmer.

Stay tuned for more exciting ups and downs as I try to navigate this crazy world of code, testing suites, software, frameworks and all things in between. 

Wish me luck!
